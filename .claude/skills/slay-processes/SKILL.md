Processes are background tasks managed by the SlayZone app — distinct from PTY terminal sessions (see slay-pty). These include automation runners, background jobs, and other managed child processes.

All process commands require the SlayZone app to be running, as data comes from the app's HTTP API.

## Commands

- `slay processes list [--json]`
  List all managed processes. Shows ID, status, label, command, PID, and start time.

- `slay processes logs <id> [-n <lines>]`
  Print the last N lines of a process's output buffer. Default is 50 lines.

- `slay processes kill <id>`
  Kill a running process.

- `slay processes follow <id>`
  Stream process output in real time. For live processes, uses SSE (Server-Sent Events) and streams indefinitely until the process exits or the connection drops. For already-finished processes, dumps the full output as plain text and returns immediately.
